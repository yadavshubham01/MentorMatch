## Description:
This project showcases my development skills in creating a full-stack web application for a mentorship matching platform. The platform allows users to register, set up profiles as mentors or mentees, and find mentorship matches based on skills and interests. It includes user authentication, profile management, and connection requests. The UI is designed to be clean and responsive, ensuring an optimal experience across devices.

I also implemented a basic matchmaking algorithm that suggests potential connections and a notification system to inform users of new requests.

Development Approach

The Mentorship Matching Platform is designed with a modular approach, ensuring scalability, maintainability, and user satisfaction. The development process is divided into key phases:

1. User Interface Design

CSS Framework: Tailwind CSS is employed for its simplicity, utility classes, and responsiveness, enabling rapid UI prototyping.

##Pages:

Registration and Login: Secure and intuitive forms with input validation and error feedback.

Profile Setup: A dynamic form allowing users to specify roles, skills, and interests.

User Discovery: A searchable and filterable list of users with pagination for improved navigation.

Matchmaking: An interactive interface displaying suggested matches, with actions to connect or explore further.

2. Core Functionality

User Authentication:

Implemented with JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for secure authentication.

Passwords are hashed using bcrypt for data security.

Profile Management:

Users can create, edit, and delete profiles seamlessly.

Role-specific profile customization (mentor or mentee).

Matching Algorithm:

A rule-based matching system using SQL queries to find overlaps in skills and interests.

Suggestions are ranked based on shared attributes and user preferences.

Connection Requests:

A two-way request and response system to manage mentorship connections.

Notifications:

A real-time notification system using server-sent events (SSE) to update users on mentorship requests and updates.

3. Database Integration

Relational Database:

PostgreSQL is used for its robustness and support for advanced queries.

Key tables include Users, Profiles, MentorshipRequests, and Notifications.

Relationships:

Users and Profiles have a one-to-one relationship.

MentorshipRequests link users in a many-to-many relationship with statuses (pending, accepted, declined).

Data Security:

Sensitive data (e.g., passwords) is encrypted.

Input validation and parameterized queries prevent SQL injection.

Challenges and Solutions

1. Matching Algorithm Complexity

Challenge: Developing a scalable algorithm for matching mentors and mentees with diverse interests and skill levels.
Solution: A simple SQL-based solution was implemented initially, with plans to integrate machine learning in future iterations for enhanced matching accuracy.

2. Notification System

Challenge: Real-time notification delivery for user interactions.
Solution: Implemented SSE for real-time updates. Alternative methods like WebSockets are considered for future scalability.

3. Data Validation and Security

Challenge: Ensuring robust data protection and input validation.
Solution: Form inputs are validated on both client and server sides, and sensitive data is encrypted before storage.

4. Handling No Matches Found

Challenge: Ensuring a positive user experience when no matches are available.
Solution: Display prompts to broaden search criteria and provide tips for optimizing profile visibility.
